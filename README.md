<h1 align="center">mpstubcloths</h1>

A simple FiveM conversion for [Alex106's mod on GTA5mods website](https://www.gta5-mods.com/player/mp-stub-clothes-patch).

## Information:
This mod replaces all the stub files of the MP characters clothes with "empty" drawables in order to prevent the game from crashing and makes scrolling past a certain ID work

DLCs with stub files:
- mp2023_01
- mp2023_02
- mp2024_01
- mpg9ec
- mpsum2_g9ec

## Installation

To 'install' this into your FiveM server, simply drag and drop the `mpstubcloths` folder into your FiveM server's resources folder or wherever you have your usual 'EUP' organised.

Open your server.cfg file and add the following:

```cfg
ensure mpstubcloths
```
